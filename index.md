Aloha,

My name is Kuba and this is my small place in the internet, but you're welcome here. 

On a daily basis I spend a lot of my time writing code and fighting with tests (unit tests, school tests, all of them). 

I have other stuff I like but I don't know (as I'm writing it) if you can find it here. You should probably check it.

If I write something - beacuse sometimes I do - it goes here.

Make yourself at home!
